you make whole wrong project i want that when user input their count in index 1 and its multiply by values (30,20,10.5,3,2,1)which is already given with index 30 all values have 30 counts when you enter count number 0 it means it go with next values which is 20 like that and then after multiply the total number of value and count after that total all the totals which i got and then we have to go next step other wise error is please feel up the above values so next step is opening balance it which is the yesterdays closing balance after i write that next is activated books means total new lotto books balance which i open today and then addition of opening balance and activated balance total shows in bottom after enter both values then todays balance which is total for all counts and values in last for today total so we have to subtract total of (opening balance and activates total and subtract of todays balance) so its gives total instant sold tickets now we have to enter a todays net sales and credit either its + or  - we have to put amount with - for subtract and its gives total of instant tickets sold and net sales and credit's after puting all amount
